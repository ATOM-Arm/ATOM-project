# ü§ñ Robotic Arm Project

Welcome to the **main repository** of the *ATOM PROJECT*, developed by undergraduate students of Computer Science at Dom Helder School.

This repository serves as the central hub for documentation, coordination, and high-level planning of our modular project ecosystem, which includes hardware, software, vision, and control systems.

## üåê Project Overview

This initiative aims to develop a functional robotic arm equipped with computer vision capabilities, integrating 3D-printed parts, Arduino-based control systems, and Python-powered image recognition tools.

The project is **based on the InMoov open-source robotics platform**, adapted and customized for educational and experimental purposes.

## üì¶ Modular Repository Ecosystem

Our project is divided into the following modular GitHub repositories:

| Repository             | Description                                                   |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `software`             | Codes for computer vision, Arduino communication, and logic control |
| `hardware`             | 3D mechanical parts, electronic schematics, components and Arduino code |
| `utils`                | Auxiliary tools and automation scripts                         |
| `docs`                 | Academic documentation, planning files, and technical references |
<!--
| `tests`                | System testing, calibration routines, and evaluation logs       |
| `robotic-arm-site`     | Public website and visual project showcase                     |
| `robotic-arm-simulator`| Simulation environment (e.g. Unity, ROS)                       |
| `robotic-arm-ai`       | Machine learning / AI-based modules                            |
