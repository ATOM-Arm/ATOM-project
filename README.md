# ü§ñ Robotic Arm Project

Welcome to the **main repository** of the *ATOM PROJECT*, developed by undergraduate students of Computer Science at Dom Helder School.

This repository serves as the central hub for documentation, coordination, and high-level planning of our modular project ecosystem, which includes hardware, software, vision, and control systems.

--- 

## üåê Project Overview

This initiative aims to develop a functional robotic arm equipped with computer vision capabilities, integrating 3D-printed parts, Arduino-based control systems, and Python-powered image recognition tools.

The project is **based on the InMoov open-source robotics platform**, adapted and customized for educational and experimental purposes.

## üì¶ Modular Repository Ecosystem

Our project is divided into the following modular GitHub repositories:

| Repository | Description |
|---|---|
| `ATOM-project` | Main repository with general documentation, project overview, team organization, and status. |
| `hardware` | Dedicated repository for physical and technical files. |
| `software` | Code related to computational systems (Python, CVZone, control). |
| `utils` | Scripts, tools, prototypes, or useful files that do not fit directly into other modules. |
| `docs` | Repository for academic documentation, planning files, and technical references. |
| `paper` | Academic papers, articles, and research related to the project. |
<!--

| `tests`                | System testing, calibration routines, and evaluation logs       |
| `robotic-arm-site`     | Public website and visual project showcase                     |
| `robotic-arm-simulator`| Simulation environment (e.g. Unity, ROS)                       |
| `robotic-arm-ai`       | Machine learning / AI-based modules                            |
| `robotic-arm-publications` | Posters, papers, and formal publications                    |
