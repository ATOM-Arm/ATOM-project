# 🤖 Robotic Arm Project

Welcome to the **main repository** of the *Robotic Arm with Computer Vision*, developed by undergraduate students of Computer Science at Dom Helder School – **GIC Group 2025**.

This repository serves as the central hub for documentation, coordination, and high-level planning of our modular project ecosystem, which includes hardware, software, vision, and control systems.

--- 

## 🌐 Project Overview

This initiative aims to develop a functional robotic arm equipped with computer vision capabilities, integrating 3D-printed parts, Arduino-based control systems, and Python-powered image recognition tools.

The project is **based on the InMoov open-source robotics platform**, adapted and customized for educational and experimental purposes.
